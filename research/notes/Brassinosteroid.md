# Brassinosteroid

Brassinosteroid (BR) is an essential part of the hormone network in *arabidopsis* roots, and has shown to promote both longitudinal and radial growth in a spatiotemporal manner ([[@ackerman-lavert2020]]). Unlike auxin, BR is not transported over long distances through the vascular tissue, but does diffuse locally ([[@vukasinovic2021]]). Each cell synthesizes its own BR, based on a gradient of signalling enzymes that reaches a maximum in the elongation zone ([[@vukasinovic2021]]).  In the vascular tissue, BR has been shown to interact antagonististically with auxin in order to maintain the division and elongation zones ([[@chaiwanon2015]]). Notably, BR is also known to promote auxin biosynthesis in the epidermis, which unveils a context-specific relationship between BR and auxin ([[@vragovic2015]]).  Finally, BR has been shown to indirectly influence auxin by upregulating transcription of the PIN2 and PIN4 transporters ([[@hacham2012]]).
