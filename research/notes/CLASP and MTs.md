# CLASP and MTs

Microtubules (MTs) are rigid polymers that guide the deposition of cellulose on the cell membrane. Depending on their orientation, MTs can either restrict or induce growth in the cell ([[@ambrose2011]]). Transverse MT arrays promote growth due to the minimal tension they create along the longitudinal axis. On the other hand, transfacial bundles created by the protein CLASP will restrict growth in all directions. BR has been shown to inhibit CLASP and thus promote growth ([[@ruan2018]]). However, CLASP also upregulates the BR receptor BRI1, which creates a stable positive-negative feedback loop ([[@ruan2018]]). Additionally, CLASP has been shown to promote the recycling of PIN2 ([[@ambrose2013]]), but further research is needed to determine the complete crosstalk relationship between CLASP and auxin.

## [[@halat2020]]
- CLASP protein levels were greatly reduced in dark-grown seedlings
- Removing seedlings from light resulted in a shift from TFBs to OTAs, resulting in a reduced meristem
- Additionally, dark-grown seedlings experienced degradation of PIN2 auxin transporters and BRI1 receptors, which are sustained by CLASP
- The MTs in dark-grown cells were sparse, suggesting that the overall concentration of tubulin was decreased

The following observations were made about the degradation of CLASP in dark-grown seedlings:
- The degradation was not caused by cellular autophagy (recycling) or via the proteasome, a structure that degrades damaged proteins.
- CLASP transcription factors *increased* by 2.5x in dark-grown seedlings, for which BR inhibition was only partially responsible.
- The authors propose that a translational checkpoint maintains low levels of CLASP when root division and elongation are unnecessary, preventing the accumulation of CLASP transcript from being converted into protein.

## Target of Rapamycin (TOR)

- The TOR kinase inhibits degradation of the BZR1 transcription factor, which regulates thousands of genes relevant to BR signalling.
- TORIN2 is a competitive inhibitor of the TOR kinase. Applying TORIN2 to the root causes BR signalling to shut down, arrests growth, and upregulates CLASP.
