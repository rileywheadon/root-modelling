# Introduction

Root growth in *arabidopsis thaliana* is a tightly regulated process governed by a network of interacting hormones. Central to this network is the hormone auxin, which has been linked to nearly every aspect of cell development ([[@saini2013]]). Additionally, at least eight other substances ([[@tian2018]]), including cytokinin, brassinosteroids (BR), and ethylene have been shown to contribute to promoting robust and adaptable hormone gradients within the root. The extensive measurement of these hormones, their derivatives, and their behaviour ([[@verbelen2006]], [[@kramer2007]], [[@marhavy2011]], [[@ambrose2013]]) has provided fertile ground for mathematical modelling. While many approaches have been employed in modelling these hormone gradients ([[@rutten2022]]), our research will develop a  two-dimensional model on a longitudinal cross section of the growing root.


Scientists in the field have done considerable work on modelling auxin-cytokinin crosstalk ([[@muraro2013]], [[@mahonen2014]], [[@band2014]], [[@dimambro2017]], [[@salvi2020]], [[@mellor2020]])  and some research into auxin-ethylene crosstalk ([[@moore2015]]). However, mathematical models of auxin-BR crosstalk have been limited ([[@ibanes2009]]). Additionally, only a small subset of existing models incorporate root growth, which has been shown to influence hormone gradients ([[@rutten2022]]). It is from these observations that we arrive at our two main research questions:
-  How do BR, CLASP, and microtubules (MTs) influence hormone gradients and root growth? 
- How does the addition of BR-auxin crosstalk to *in silico* roots affect the reliability of these models?


This summary proceeds with a brief overview of biological information about *arabidopsis* roots, followed by an exploration of prior modelling methods and results. Then, we will provide a brief overview of the various components of our proposed model.
