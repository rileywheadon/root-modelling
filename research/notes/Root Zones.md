# Root Zones

Quiescent Zone and Root Cap
- The root cap is a group of cells at the root tip that protect it from debris.

Division Zone
- High levels of [[CLASP]], which allows [[Microtubules]] to cross cell edges and form transfacial bundles (TFBs).
- TFBs suppress the formation of OTAs, promoting rapid division cycles and creating many small cells.

Elongation Zone
- Low levels of CLASP, leading to the formation of OTAs. Cell division ceases and cells undergo rapid elongation.

Differentiation Zone 
- The above information also aligns with Tim's work, which found that longer cells produce longitudinal MT arrays, which would cause cell growth to slow drastically upon reaching a certain length.
