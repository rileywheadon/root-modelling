The PIN-FORMED (PIN) family of auxin transporters is responsible for mediating auxin efflux within the growing root ([[@krecek2009]]). The polarized distribution of PIN proteins within each cell, including PIN1, PIN2, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7, is instrumental in producing a stable auxin gradient ([[@yang2020]]). Since there is some redundancy between different PIN-family proteins ([[@vieten2005]]), PIN-mediated auxin transport can be generally categorized into four regions.



1.  PIN1 transports auxin shootward through the vascular tissue in the basal meristem.
2. PIN4 transports auxin shootward through the vascular tissue in the apical meristem, and into the quiescent centre.
3. PIN3 and PIN7 redistribute auxin within the root cap.
4. PIN2 transports auxin shootward through the epidermis and rootward through the endodermis.

The amount of PIN transporters on the cell membrane is mediated by intracellular recycling ([[@ambrose2013]], [[@marhava2022]]). While it has been previously suggested that auxin inhibits endocytosis and thus increases the amount of PIN on the membrane ([[@paciorek2005]]), new evidence suggests that auxin actually regulates PIN polarity in a concentration and protein specific manner ([[@marhava2022]]). 


Auxin influx is determined by the nonpolar AUX/LAX family of transporters ([[@swarup2012]]) as well as passive diffusion through the cell membrane. Members of the AUX/LAX transporter family perform similar functions but are located in different regions of the cell. For instance, AUX1 is concentrated in the epidermal tissue ([[@swarup2001]]), while LAX2 and LAX3 are located in the vascular tissue and columella ([[@swarup2012]]). Together, the PIN efflux transporters and AUX/LAX influx transporters produce a distinct auxin gradient within the cell ([[@band2014]]). In healthy roots, this gradient is characterized by an auxin maximum at the QC, gradually decreasing auxin levels up through the vascular tissue, and low auxin levels in the epidermal tissue ([[@grieneisen2007]]).
