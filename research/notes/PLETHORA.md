# PLETHORA

When exposed to high concentrations of auxin for a long period of time, *arabidopsis* roots experience an increase in PLETHORA transcription factors (PLT) ([[@mahonen2014]]). PLT is known to upregulate the transcription of the YUCCA3 gene, which increases auxin biosynthesis. Additionally, PLT modulates cell elongation and differentiation on a much longer time scale than auxin. This allows the root to respond quickly to environmental stimuli via auxin redistribution, while maintaining stable zonation due to transcriptional regulation of PLT ([[@mahonen2014]]).
