 The division zone is up to $200\mu m$ away from the root cap junction ($160 \mu m$ on average) and contained approximately $21$  cells per column.
- Growth from $4.5 \mu m$ to $9 \mu m$ takes approximately 18h, or the length of one cell cycle (Beemster and Baskin, 2000)

 The transition zone ranges from $200 \mu m$ from the root cap junction to $520 \mu m$. Average cell length in the TZ begins at $8 \mu m$ and reaches $30 \mu m$ by the time it leaves the transition zone in a period of 10h. 
	- Elongation in the bottom part of the TZ is negligible.
	- Elongation speeds up significantly towards the top of the TZ.
	- Vascular cells do not divide, but distal (border) cells can.
	
 Fast cell elongation occurs from $520 \mu m$ to $900 \mu m$, where cells can increase in size from $35\mu m$ to $135 \mu m$ in two hours. Further  slower growth is observed up to $1500 \mu m$ from the root cap junction.

In mitotic regions, cell division takes place at an approximately constant rate of $4\%$ per hour in wild type plants. Exogenous cytokinin and auxin decrease the division rate by $1\%$ per hour per treatment (Beemster and Baskin 2000).
