## Static Root Auxin Model
- Cells are treated as columns of rectangles
- Auxin transport is mediated by unidirectional and background PINs
- Unidirectional PINs have a cell-type dependent polar distribution:
	- Border cells: superior PINs
	- Epidermal cells: basal-lateral PINs
	- Vascular cells: lateral PINs
	- Root cap: uniform PINs
- The distribution of PINs is sufficient to develop the experimentally observed auxin gradient. This is the **Reflux Loop** model.

## Growing Root Auxin Model
- The growing root model makes the assumption that that low auxin promotes elongation, and high auxin promotes division 
- Columella and quiescent centre cells don't divide
- Division occurs after a fixed period of growth if the auxin level is sufficiently high 
- There is a minimum size for division and a maximum size for growth 
- The model finds that greater division occurs higher in the vascular tissue than in the border tissue, in line with experiments
