## Modelling Auxin and Plasmodesmata

- Genetic manipulation of plasmodesmata has been shown to affect auxin dynamics in multiple scenarios
- Uses a vertex model, with a directed graph defining each cell wall region and cell 
- PIN, AUX1, and LAX distributions are from [[@band2014]]
- Weak background efflux carriers were added to account for non-polar PINs and ABCB transporters 
- Generated a system of linear ODEs for the concentration of auxin each cell and cell wall compartment 
- By adding a constant plasmodesmata term to the ODE, the authors achieved a significant improvement in accuracy
