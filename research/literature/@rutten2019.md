Proteins often included in root zone models:
- Hormone transporters (i.e. PIN, AUX1/LAX, etc.)
- Biosynthesis and degradation enzymes (IPTs for CK, etc.)
- Hormone receptors (GID and DELLA for GA)
- Downstream factors (PLETHORA and WOX5)

The **Chemiosmotic Theory of Auxin Transport** states that auxin can only be actively exported from cells.

## Auxin Flow Models

- [[@grieneisen2007]]: **Reflux Loop**
- [[@mironova2010]]: **Reflected Flow**
- [[@tian2014]]: **Separated Flow**

## Auxin Transport, Synthesis, and Degradation

- [[@mironova2010]] explores auxin concentration specific PIN expression
- [[@band2014]] and [[@moore2015]] include cell-specific AUX1 distribution
- [[@dimambro2017]] and [[@mellor2016]] include increased auxin degradation in distal regions. [[@tian2014]] and [[@moore2015]] include increased auxin production around the QC

## Cytokinin

- Cytokinin antagonizes auxin by repressing PIN1, PIN3, PIN7 ([[@miyawaki2004]]) and induces local auxin degradation ([[@dimambro2017]])
- Cytokinin is produced in the root cap but its signalling elements are mainly concentrated in the elongation zone
- Further research is needed to develop an accurate model of cytokinin including its signalling elements and transport patterns
- Most models to date have superimposed the region where cytokinin signalling is active (i.e. in the elongation zone)

## Gibberellin (GA)

- GA concentrations increase with cell size, and GA diffusion is limited
- Existing models include GA as the means by which auxin upregulates CK 

## PLETHORA Transcription Factors (PLTs)

- PLTs are present in the meristematic zone, and are upregulated slowly by auxin ([[@mahonen2014]], [[@salvi2020]])
- Auxin controls the rates of division, expansion and differentiation, but PLTs dictate where cells divide, expand, or differentiate
- PLTs are highly stable proteins that travel via diffusion through plasmodesmata


## Outstanding Questions

- Do sub-cellular and sub-wall concentration gradients influence hormone distribution on a intercellular scale? 
- How can parameter-fitting methods be used to improved the accuracy of multi-scale cell root models?
- How is symplastic root growth coordinated in the radial direction?

## Unexplored Phenomena

- Non-phosphorylated PINs have significantly lower auxin throughput than phosphorylated PINs, making PIN phosphorylation an important area for further study. Similar results likely apply to AUX/LAX.
- ABCB/PGP auxin transporters complement PIN and also contribute to the stability of PIN levels on the membrane.
- The existence of active transporters for other hormones (SWEET for GA).
