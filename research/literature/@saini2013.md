Auxin takes two primary forms: 
- Indole-3-acetic-acid (IAA) is the most common form, responsible for the root system architecture and various stages of root development.
- Indole-3-butyric-acid (IBA) is also endogenously produced.

Auxin transport also takes two forms:
- Auxin is transported from aerial shoots to the roots through mature cells (i.e. Auxin can move freely through differentiated cells).
- Short distance transport is mediated through three transporters:
	- [[AUX1]]/[[LAX]] proteins -- *influx carriers*
	- pin formed proteins ([[PIN]]) -- *efflux carriers*
	- p-glycoprotein (PGP) -- *minor role*

Cytokinin increases rates of cell differentiation.
