- In the vascular tissue, the auxin/BR gradients are inversely proportional.
- In the epidermal tissue, the auxin/BR gradients are proportional (both high in the elongation zone, and low in the meristematic zone)
- Figure **(c)** shows that BR activity must have opposing effects on the number of meristematic cells for coherent root growth.
- BR positively controls the expression levels of auxin biosynthesis in the root epidermis.


[[Brassinosteroid]] affects the cellular localization of auxin efflux carriers, such as PIN3, PIN4 and influx carriers, AUX1/LAXs (Saini 2013).
- Hacham (2011) find that BR is *not* correlated with expression levels of the auxin efflux carriers PIN1, PIN3, PIN7.
- Hacham (2012) find that BR *is* correlated with expression levels of the efflux carriers PIN2 and PIN4.
