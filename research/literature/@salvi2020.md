An approach to [[Growth Step]] within a lattice-based framework:
- Cells grow by adding a row of lattice points at specified time intervals based on experimental results.
- When the cytoplasm of a cell grows, the resulting dilution of hormone concentrations is adjusted for.
- Cells are assumed to coordinate developmental decisions perfectly with their neighbours. Growth of a row of cells is determined *only* by hormone levels in the vascular tissue.
- Elongation rate per micron is held constant ([[@vanderweele2003]]).

Effects of PLT included in this paper's model model are:
- PLT upregulates the auxin producing YUCCA enzyme
- PLT downregulates the auxin degrading GH3 enzyme
- PLT promotes division and restricts elongation

Cytokinin transcription factors (ARR) and SHY2 are also included.
