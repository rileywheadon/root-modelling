Model features:
- Static, biologically accurate root tip 
- Prescribed PIN distribution with uniform efflux permeability 
- Weak background efflux to account for nonpolar (background) PINs and the presence of ABCB transporters
- Auxin production was added to the root tip
- Uniform auxin degradation within every cell 
- Auxin concentrations are uniform in each cell 

Results:
- By using the DII-VENUS auxin sensor, Band and coworkers found that PIN dependent efflux alone is insufficient for an accurate model 
- After adding auxin influx carriers (AUX1/LAX), the authors were able to replicate the observed DII-VENUS gradient
