This paper explores the **Reflected Flow** model of auxin transport, which is applicable when the root has not yet developed a redistributing root cap. In the reflected flow model, Auxin travels down the shoot via PIN1 efflux transporters, before reaching a "wall" at the root tip. Then, the resulting buildup of auxin restricts PIN1 expression, producing the desired gradient.

Interestingly, this paper also implemented different PIN expression levels for each type of PIN resulting from specific auxin concentrations.
- Low auxin concentration stimulated expression of PIN2 (which transports auxin up the shoot via border cells)
- Medium auxin concentration stimulated expression of PIN1 (transporting auxin down the shoot via vascular cells)
- High auxin concentration stimulated expression of PIN3 (redistributes auxin within the root cap)
