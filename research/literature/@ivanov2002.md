Because plant cells share a cell wall, they cannot grow independently of one another. In other words, "cell sliding" is impossible. This phenomenon is known as **Symplastic Growth** ([[@ivanov2002]]).

A consequence of symplastic growth is that at a given distance from the root tip all cells must have the same expansion rate.   Due to the fact that the distributions of auxin and other hormones are spatially regulated in both the transverse and longitudinal direction, defining a growth function that is constant along the horizontal axis is challenging.
