Modelling study of auxin cytokinin crosstalk:
- Uses a biologically accurate root tip ([[@band2014]]) 
- Uses narrower vascular cells, wider epidermal cells 
- Grid-based model with intracellular diffusion
- Implements a cytokinin-dependent auxin decay rate (GH3)
- Influx carriers AUX1/LAX were set to a constant permeability of 2um/s 
- PINs have different permeabilities based on tissue and zone
- All cells have a base rate of auxin production and decay
- The model assumes no-flux boundaries (as in Grieneisen) and a constant influx at the top vascular cells

Results:
- The authors successfully replicate an auxin minimum at the TZ which has been observed *in vivo*
