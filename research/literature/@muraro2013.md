Experimental observations suggest that cytokinin acts as a short-range signal that moves through the vascular tissue.

## 1D Continuous Auxin/ CK Model

- Root divide into three zones (elongation, transition, division) 
- Auxin is transported by advection/diffusion relative to PIN
- Auxin advection is negatively affected by cytokinin 
- Cytokinin is transported by diffusion alone 
- Zonation is based on cytokinin to auxin ratios
- Growth rates by zone are assumed constant 
- Authors observed how changing auxin/cytokinin boundary conditions changes the zonation 

## 1D Cellular Auxin/CK Model

- Cell lengths cannot exceed 200 micrometers 
- Cells in the DZ must double in size before dividing (Ubeda-Tomas 2009) - They looked at wild-type roots (4% division/hour) and treated roots (3% division/hour) (Beemster and Baskin 2000) 
- Over-expression of auxin should reduce the total length of the root by shortening the EZ (but lengthening the DZ) 
- Over-expression of cytokinin should reduce the total number of cells and reduce the total length of the root
