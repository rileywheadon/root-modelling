Based on experimentally observed PIN2 distributions, the authors propose the **Separated Flow** model for auxin distribution. In this model, PINs in the root cortex (inner epidermal) and endodermis (outer epidermal) face outwards from one another, resulting in a separation of the upwards and downwards auxin flow.
