The PLETHORA (PLT) gene-transcription network controls the zones of the root, separating the differentiation, elongation, and division zones.

PLT transcription factors display a gradient that reaches a maximum at the root tip.
- Auxin *slowly* influences the PLT gradient, which determines zonation.
- Auxin *rapidly* induces cell elongation, division, and differentiation.

## Models of PLT

Experiments show that auxin gradually upregulates PLT over time. By using only this assumption, combined with the finding that PLT determines zonation, the authors were unable to build an accurate model.

In the "PLT-spread" model, the authors make the assumption that PLT has a longer lifespan and diffuses between cells. This produced a longer gradient which was closer to the observed results.

Finally, the authors assume that auxin determines zonation and PLT indirectly provides feedback on a longer time scale. This adjustment produced the desired zonation pattern, and is the conclusion drawn by the authors.
