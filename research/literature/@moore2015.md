Modelling study of of auxin, CK, and ethylene crosstalk:
- Auxin biosynthesis is stimulated by ethylene and inhibited by cytokinins 
- PINs promoted by both auxin and ethylene, but inhibited by cytokinins 
- Levels of cytokinin are determined only by production and degradation 
- Ethylene and cyotkinin are assumed to diffuse freely
- Uses a grid based model with intracellular diffusion
