## Overview

"A great PhD student is a great scholar pretending to be a student. A great supervisor is someone who recognizes this and pretends to be a supervisor."

### Reading Advice
- Read a paper a day and take good notes
- Synthesize information in Obsidian

### Researching Advice
- Don't bite off more than you can chew
- The simplest solution is often the best
- Working slow is working fast
- Write tests and documentation

### Writing Advice
- Write every day in "paper-ready" language
- Justify every detail and argue every decisions

### Presenting Advice
- Slides should have minimal text and big clear diagrams
- Work around the "big picture" message of the talk
- "Tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, and then tell them what you told them."

>- Failed to construct the root mesh using a Voronoi diagram. It is hard to set a boundary and get the mesh into the right shape.
>- Completed the mesh generator using iterative methods. The code is quite messy and needs to be revised.
>- Failed to make a diagram for my writing using TikZ. I learned that figures should be the last step in the writing process.
