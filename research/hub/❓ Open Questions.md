# ‚ùì Open Questions


**BR & Auxin**
- Are there any mechanisms that cause BR to effect Auxin (other than through CLASP and PINs)?
- Similarly, are there any mechanisms that cause Auxin to effect BR?
- In the model, we use PINs as the mechanism of transport for auxin. Are there any other mechanisms that we should know about?
- Similarly, how does BR move between root cells, and is establishing a static BR gradient a reasonable modelling choice.

**BR Receptors & Clasp**
- Does the rate at which receptors are pulled back into the cell depend on whether or not they are bounded? (Does $k_{\text{in}}^{ 0 } = k_{\text{in}}^{ B }$? )
- Why does CLASP increase the number of BR receptors?

**PINs**
- How does CLASP influence the PINs?
- What other mechanisms influence the  PINs?

**Mechanisms of Division**
- How is division regulated in the meristematic zone (the current model looks only at auxin levels).
- Do cells divide upon reaching a certain age, or a certain length?

**Mechanisms of Growth**
- Is growth constant or linear? In other words, does the growth rate of a cell depend on its current size?
- Border cells have a different level of auxin compared to vascular cells at the same height level. How and why is root growth (horizontally) uniform?

What are open and reticulate patterns (in the context of auxin flow)?
